# Face Mask Detection

This project focuses on detecting whether individuals are wearing face masks using both classical machine learning (MLP) and deep learning (CNN with transfer learning). It demonstrates the development and comparison of different modeling strategies for a real-world classification task.

## üéØ Objective

To develop models that can classify face images as:
- Wearing a mask (`face_mask`)
- Not wearing a mask (`face_no_mask`)

## üß† CNN Model with Transfer Learning (PyTorch)

The `Mask_Pytorch_Transfer_learning.ipynb` notebook implements a deep learning pipeline for face mask detection using **PyTorch** and **transfer learning**. A pre-trained CNN model (e.g., DenseNet121) is fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of masked and unmasked face images.

Key components:
- Uses transfer learning to leverage pre-trained image features
- Preprocesses images by resizing and converting to tensors
- Trains and evaluates on a custom image dataset from Google Drive
- Achieves high accuracy (~97%) 

This model significantly outperforms classical baselines and demonstrates the strength of deep learning for image classification.

## üì¶ Classical MLP Model (Baseline)

The `Mask__MLP.ipynb` notebook implements a basic image classification pipeline using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** model. Face images are resized, flattened into feature vectors, and used to train a classifier that predicts whether the person is wearing a mask. While less powerful than CNN-based approaches, this notebook demonstrates a classical machine learning baseline for comparison.
